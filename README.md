# TMSR-Course

### The goal is: 

>“A university level TMSR education free for anyone to use that inspires future nuclear engineers and scientists while it organizes teachers and students”

### It should:
* Give students hope: inspire the next generation with a doable energy solution
* Open the field for innovation: lead to new thinking in nuclear
* Career: feed students into a thriving industry or academic research

### Who is it for?
We cater the course to the top of the line technology students in all fields across the world. 

The course is neither intended to be given by Thorium Energy World nor the contributors (the ones creating the material). Instead we want to provide all the means to incentivise and facilitate universities and similar organisations to give the course themselves. 

However, it is an open education. This means that anyone interested can get a hold of the course material. 

### How do we achieve it? 
We supply and market the education as follows:

A PhD level course of 7.5 credits.

The course consists of two parts. The first part is lectures where each comprise the material: 

**Presentation (2*45 mins)**: to be used by a teacher (slides have comments containing all key subjects).

**Talk**: text that goes with the presentation.

**Quiz (4-7 questions)**: conceptually focused questions along the way. Could be integrated into the presentations.

**Exercise problems (1-2 comprehensive)**: students learn how to solve typical problems apparent in the field.

The second part is a **project**. In the project the student will get the opportunity to work on a challenging real world connected problem in the field of TMSRs for the student to deepen her/his expertise. Ideally, the project unites the students with researchers and developers, and vice versa, through a cooperation.

## This repository

Initially, this repository will complement the existing _Google Drive_ files. 

The main objective here is to work on interactive content that can be integrated into a web platform. The main tool for this content will be based on Jupyter. 

Furthermore, the repository may also functions as the base for a JupyterHub server that can serve as a working platform for developing the course content and in the future host servers for students participating in the TMSR-Course.
